This is a cleaned code repository for my thesis:

"Learning new data representations for Parkinson's Disease finger tapping test"

This repository contains the code I wrote for my thesis but all data removed for privacy purposes. I have included 2 data files with a single example line each, `data/video_features.csv` which would have contained the original video features I got. And `data/updated_video_features.csv` which contained the data I got later during my thesis.

This repository also contains my thesis itself with the file name `BSc Thesis.pdf`. This document has a big appendix which makes it take long to load in PDF viewers which is why I have added a version without the appendix (`BSc Thesis (without appendix).pdf`) which loads more quickly.
