This is a cleaned code repository for my thesis:

"Learning new data representations for Parkinson's Disease finger tapping test"

it contains the code I wrote for my thesis but all data removed for privacy purposes. As well as my thesis report itself. Although I have included the data csv file which has a single example row of data as a reference.
