This is a cleaned code repository for my thesis:

"Learning new data representations for Parkinson's Disease finger tapping test"

This repository contains the code I wrote for my thesis but all data removed for privacy purposes. As well as my thesis report itself. 

I have included 2 data files with a single example line each, `video_features.csv` which would have contained the original video features I got. And `updated_video_features.csv` which contained the data I got later during my thesis.
